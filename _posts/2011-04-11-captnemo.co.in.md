title: New domain name : CaptNemo.in

My experiences with indialinks turned out to be horrible as I did not read the fine print in the cheap domain offer that the price did not include a DNS management server. Which meant that I could squat on my domain for as long as I wanted but not redirect it to any useful services (google apps, blogger, wordpress, github etc) using CNAME records, since it *did not provide me with DNS mgt*. But no, wait, all that could be had for 200/- more, if only you had read the fine print earlier. So I was stuck with a domain and no way to link it with github (where I plan to host this).
