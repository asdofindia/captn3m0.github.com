title: New domain name CaptNemo.in
---

My experiences with indialinks turned out to be horrible as I did not read the fine print in the cheap domain offer that the price did not include a DNS management server. Which meant that I could squat on my domain for as long as I wanted but not redirect it to any useful services (google apps, blogger, wordpress, github etc) using CNAME records, since it *did not provide me with DNS mgt*. But no, wait, all that could be had for 200/- more, if only you had read the fine print earlier. So I was stuck with a domain and no way to link it with github (where I plan to host this).

However zoneedit.com came to my rescue. I was able to setup ZoneEdit as my DNS server by setting up nameservers for my domain address (Indialinks allowed this thankfully). Zonedit then allowed me to edit my CNAME, and all the rest DNS records easily. All of this was done as part of getting the Github model of Git + Jekyll to run locally (more on this later).
 
UPDATE : I waited for 2 days for ZoneEdit to work, but since it did not respond to my new DNS entries, so I moved to EditDNS free service, which responded pretty quickly in recognizing me domain. However my load times seem big for me. If this problem persists, I am thinking of migrating my domain to some other registrar, which may offer DNS. 

So how easy is it exactly to host your site with github, using Jekyll ?
Pretty easy, I would say
