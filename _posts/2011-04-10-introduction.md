Welcome to my github pages. This will be my personal code blog site, or something of that sort. I will soon be transitioning this site to Jekyll for easier publishing and maybe move away from wordpress.

I am a proficient coder in PHP, working on various internal projects at SDSLabs.

Here is my current setup :
* Dell Inspiron 1545
* T-6400 Intel Core 2 Duo
* Ubuntu Natty Narwhal (Default OS)
* Elementary OS (Under Testing)
* Samurai WTF, Backtrack for pen-tests
* Moved from Windows after remaining a staunch supporter for 5 years
