I recently hosted a Geek Quiz at my college along with [Giri][giri]. The quiz
was mostly geek with some sports and pop-cult trivia. Here are the slides for
the quiz (both prelims and finals):

## BackdoorCTF 2014

Last year, I was the coordinator for Backdoor CTF 2013, a jeopardy-style CTF
contest hosted by [SDSLabs][sdslabs] under the aegis of Cognizance. This year,
I contributed 3 problems to the CTF. The problems were as follows:

1. [web200](https://backdoor-web200.herokuapp.com/) - Timing Attack ([Source](https://github.com/backdoor-ctf/web200))
1. [web250](https://backdoor-web250.herokuapp.com/) - YAML Code Execution ([Source](https://github.com/backdoor-ctf/web250))
1. [web100](https://backdoor-web100.herokuapp.com/) - _ Template Code Execution ([Source](https://github.com/backdoor-ctf/web100))

You can find writeups/solutions to the problems all over the internet and on [ctftime][ctftime].
Hosting a CTF is always a humbling experience and it was great to see teams from
all over the world participating in backdoor. We hope to return next year with
even better challenges.

## Cogni Geek Quiz
After that I teamed up with Giri again (along with Sukun) for the Cogni Geek Quiz,
hosted by the winner of my quiz, [Vikram Rathore][vikram]. While we won the quiz
by a large margin (30 points), I managed to get my own tribute question wrong unfortunately.

However, it was a great experience involving some really nice questions. _Update_: The slides
are up at [mega](https://mega.co.nz/#F!nso0VaiK!IUBob8dqOM0UAD_Eti6DfA).
