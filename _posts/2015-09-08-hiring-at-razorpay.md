title: Working and Hiring at Razorpay

If you've been following me, you'd know that I recently joined [Razorpay][rzp]. I just took a couple days rest between coming back from HillHacks and joining the team in Bangalore.

Its been around 2 months since I joined. In that timeframe, I've worked on lots of different things, including Hiring, Architecture, Agreements, Legalese and what not. Pretty standard fare for an early stage startup, I think.

Its amazing to be surrounded by smart people; especially those I've known for a long time. I saw this tweet the other day by [@aakashlpin][aakash] (Instamojo) and it got me thinking about how we approach hiring:

>A founder friend asked how we do hiring [@instamojo](https://twitter.com/instamojo) and why do so many kickass people work here. ([Link to tweet][tweet])

Hiring has been, without doubt, one of the hardest problems we have been facing, and I totally agree with the tweet. I've been interviewing candidates for different roles, and its exactly as everyone says: Good people are hard to find, even in Bangalore.

Hiring as such, becomes one of the hardest and most important problems for a company to solve. What I've found so far:

- Resumes are bullshit
- Experience doesn't mean anything
- Good people aren't looking for new jobs
- Interview is a highly inefficient process
- Hiring Agencies are not a good enough solution

I've seen companies in India get VC funding and hire 50 new employees, breaking down the entire company because you lowered your hiring bar. TinyOwl just [fired more than 100 employees][tinyowl], Housing is firing [even more][housing]. What we're instead trying to do is scale organically, as needed; instead of splurging on hiring and not managing it properly. 
As such, similar to what Aakash tweeted, we have been very strict about our Hiring bar. Sure, it hurts to say no to candidates, but thats how you build a company.

I've also been reading a lot of the [buffer blog][buffer] posts recently, and figuring out the kind of culture we want to have. Sometimes, I think that starting a company is far more easier than building a company. To do the latter, you have to figure out way more things than just a plan to make money.

So yeah, I'm working at a startup working at cool things I love; making things people want. I'm working on problems ranging from mundanely easy to insanely challenging. I'm in Bangalore, and if this sounds interesting to you, I'd love to [have a chat](/contact/).
