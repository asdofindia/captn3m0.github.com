##Who am I, and what do I do?

I'm Abhay Rana, more popularly known as Nemo. 
I do tech things at [Razorpay](https://razorpay.com).

##What hardware do I use?

![My temporary work-desk](/img/desktop.jpg)

Most of my work is done on my [System 76 Galago UltraPro][galago]. It has a clear 14" IPS display which runs at full HD powered by the Intel i7-4750HQ processor and Intel HD 5200 Iris Pro graphic card. I work on VMs sometimes, so I had its RAM upgraded to 8GB. I also shifted to a Samsung EVO SSD (120GB).

My phone these days is a [Yu Yureka][yureka]. I backup all of my media to a 1TB Seagate Expansion Portable HDD. Other than this, I own an iPad 2 (16GB 3G+WiFi), which I mostly use for reading books. I have a pair of [Sennheiser HD 202][hd-202], which I consider an excellent pair of headphones considering the price.

I am an ocassional gamer and use the [Logitech G300][g300] for both gaming and productivity (its heavily customizable). Since my laptop speakers aren't exactly top-notch, I rely on my [Logitech X100][x100] bluetooth speakers for listening in closed spaces.

I own a [Cooler Master QuickFire Rapid-i][quickfire] mechanical keyboard (Cherry MX brown), and absolutely love it.
It has crazy custom backlight support, and typing on it is a joy.

I am also a speedcuber; my primary cube is a [DaYan GuHong v2][guhong] (stickerless). I also own several
other cubes, including a Mirror and a Void cube.

##And what software?

![This is my desktop](/img/wallpaper.jpg)

My current distro is [Arch Linux][arch] with [i3][i3] as the window manager. My most used tools include: [Neovim][neovim], [Sublime Text 3][sublime], Google Chrome Canary, and Git. I game using Steam, and purchase DRM free games via Humble Bundle whenever possible.

My phone comes with official Cyanogen OS 12 (based on Android 5/Lollipop), and supports rooting (it doesn't void the warranty). My most used apps are: Slack, Google Inbox, [Hacker News][hnapp]. After rooting, the two most important apps for me are [AdAway][adaway] and [AFWall][afwall]. Cyanogen's built-in PrivacyGuard feature is also really good.

Most of my work is done in editors, command line, and the browser. I've switched over to Google Inbox as my default email client. I few essential extensions on my browser include: dotjs (with apache support), [Privacy Badger][privacybadger], [uBlock Origin][ublock], HTTPS Everywhere, LastPass, and Markdown Here.

I am a [Hacker News][hn] addict, and have even written an application for it. Most used webapps would be: Slack, GitHub, and WorkFlowy. I use Google Music for listening to music on the go, and cmus on the desktop.

##What would be my dream setup?

A lightweight laptop with tons of battery life, 13" display, and official Linux support (Dell Sputnik comes close). A Kindle with EPUB support would be a nice to have. I've always wanted to try a crazy multi-monitor setup.

If we're talking super-crazy, I'd love to have a thought-dictation feature. That would help _a lot_ with my writing.
