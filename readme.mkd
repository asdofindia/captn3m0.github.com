This is my new blog(running using Jekyll) and hosted on Github. I'll be migrating my wp blog posts over here as soon as I can find a stable enough plugin to do that. Till then you can visit my old blog at <piratecoders.co.cc>. 

You are free to fork this and use this as your own base for your jekyll site.
