I'd done a post on this a long time back, detailing
what all softwares I use on a daily basis. This
is an update to that post.

Since the last post, I've moved on to Linux, using
Ubuntu as my primary OS. The desktop shell of my
choice right now is Cinnamon, as it offers me
a perfect balance of speed and control.

For most of my browsing needs, I rely on a daily
build of Chromium (v29 as of now) and an install
of Google Chrome Stable as well. I switch between
them all the time. I use Firefox (nightly) only to
test out my projects from time to time.

The current editor I use is Sublime Text. It is
everything you need, and much more. I'm still to
get started using its build system, and its
plethora of packages; but its still an excellent
choice for a daily use editor. I use vim
from time to time to edit files on the command
line. I use Git for version control and github 
for posting most of the code I write.

I listen to music on my own browser-based music
player, called Muzi. It is hosted internally on
IITR, by SDSLabs. It has been a long while since I
used a native music player. I use Audacious for
listening to music sometimes, if it is unavailable
on Muzi; VLC for playing any video under the sun.

For my terminal needs, I use both the [Secure SSH
Extension][ssh] and Gnome-Terminal equally. I use
[Byobu](byobu) to manage my session, and often
connect to it from other computers as well.

I use [LinuxDC++](dcpp) for connecting to the 
SDSLabs DC Server. [Imo.im](imo) on both the
Desktop and my tablet to chat.
