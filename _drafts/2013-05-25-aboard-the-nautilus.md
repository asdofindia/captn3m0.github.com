I'd done a post on this a long time back (2009), detailing
what all softwares I use on a daily basis. This
is an update to that post.

Since the last post, I've moved on to using Linux, using
Ubuntu as my primary OS. The desktop shell of my
choice right now is [OpenBox][ob], as it offers me
a perfect balance of speed and control. I'm thinking of switching
to [Arch Linux][arch], just to get a faster experience. I use 
[Synapse][synapse] as my application launcher, because its much faster
than anything else out there.

For most of my web browsing needs, I rely on a daily
build of [Chromium][chromium] (v30 as of now) and an install
of [Google Chrome][gc] Stable as well. I switch between
them all the time. I use Firefox (stable) only to
test out my projects from time to time.

The current editor I use is [Sublime Text][st]. It is
everything you need, and much more. I'm still to
get started using its build system, and its
plethora of packages; but its still an excellent
choice for a daily use editor. I use [vim][vim]
from time to time to edit files on the command
line. I use [Git][git] for version control and [GitHub][gh]
for posting most of the code I write.

I listen to music on my own browser-based music
player, called [Muzi][muzi]. Sometimes, I'd use
[audacious][audacious] for listening to my local
music collection.

For my terminal needs, I use both the [Secure SSH
Extension][ssh] and Gnome-Terminal equally. I use
[Byobu][byobu] to manage my session, and often
connect to it from other computers as well.

I use [LinuxDC++][dcpp] for connecting to the 
SDSLabs DC Server. [Imo.im][imo] on both the
Desktop and my tablet to chat. I occasionally use [ReText][retext]
for editing markdown files. I also use [RedShift][rs] on my laptop and [f.lux][flux]
on my iPad to help me sleep better. I recommend it to everyone who is
suffering from eye-strain.

##Hardware
I own a old [Nokia 7210][nokia], and will be upgrading to a [Firefox OS Phone][fos] soon enough. I use a Dell Inspiron 1545 as my personal machine, and deploy code to Dell/HP Servers. I also use an iPad 2 (3G Model) on a daily basis (mostly for reading).

##iPad Apps
The must have iPad apps for me are [Chrome][chrome.ios], [imo][imo],  and [iBooks][ibooks]. I have installed [Mailbox][mb] alongside GMail, and haven't used GMail since
I installed it. I sometimes write stuff using [Plaintext][pt], and sketch using [Paper][paper]. I read my RSS Feed using [Newsify][newsify] and [Feedly][feedly].
