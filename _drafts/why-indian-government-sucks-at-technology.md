title: Why Indian Government Sucks at Technology

This is in wake of the not-so-anonymous attacks on the nic servers. Apparently a few people had decided to brand their own version of AnonymousIndia and hack into the nic servers. This had been viewed as almost normal in the Indian Media. This is something that happens every other day in India.

Even though there are excellent tech-security companies in India, we have never developed the right attitude to it. People still think that hacking is fun, and its something that could never happen to them. I've never seen people reading the fine print on the thousand social web sites they join now a days. Piracy is rampant in India without any checks and the Indian Government is silent.

Why? Because we are used to it. It has always happened this way. Information leaks have been a major part of the Indian history and would remain so unless we realize that the more we embrace technology; the more we become dependent on it, it is coming one step closer to the edge. 

A recent tweet by @divyekapoor reminded me of the AADHAR project, which aims to give out a unique identification number to each Indian citizen. I read out the UIDAI docs and it tells us that it would  _"prescribe protocols to ensure the confidentiality, privacy and security  of data"_, and _"follow the confidentiality, privacy and security  protocols prescribed by the UIDAI"_. A search on the uidai website gives out a little detail :

> The UID database will be guarded both physically and electronically by a few select individuals with high clearance. It will not be available even for many members of the UID staff and will be secured with the best encryption, and in a highly secure data vault. All access details will be properly logged.

This is the most that they have to say on the subject. If that makes you feel safe, remember the earlier fiasco involving the security of the EVM machines. Ultimately I'm with the government on that one, however, since a user had to have physical access to actually do any harm to the machine. But _it was possible_ and Election Council kept denying it. 

So why is this approach taken in India? Beauracracy? probably yes. But I feel that unless the technocrats rise up and actually enter the Indian Govt. technical agencies (such as NIC), nothing would change. For instance I find that almost everything that Indian government does is tailored specifically for Windows. There is no reason to plaster "Works best in Internet Explorer 6 at 1024x768" in all your web sites We already know how much the Indian government loves Windows. So much so that they get it pre-installed everywhere.

Yet there is a small faction that is working tirelessly in the other direction as well. For instance the Sakshat project has been under the news recently as well. It would ship with a version of android (which one?) with wi-fi, bluetooth and other frills. However the project has been known for shadowing and changing its details at each conference it is unvealed, so beware. It may suddenly change from an android to a Windows phone in the next one.

I've worked a little bit on online Geo-Mapping tools earlier (mostly using Google Maps API). However, I wanted some accurate data for one of my projects (such as geographical boundaries). Other sources for this data are not as reliable, and I found the bhuvan online tool to be extremely accurate in this respect. However as it turns out, this data is not public. Why? It seems that ISRO plans to sell this data to people interested in using it. Wow! So a public funded agency decides to make money from the development done using *our money*. 

Seriously, people wake up. This is the 21st century, and the most hyped buzz word today is open-source(well, after cloud). And if you really want to work on things, make them open source. Not just the technology, but the data as well. Becauase open data is essential to growth and planning of a nation, as Hans Rosling keeps on reminding us. Meanwhile, DRDO decides to go ahead and develop its own operating system. Why? Because it will be closed-source and will be much more secure than any of the variants of linux.  Or so they think.

The Informatics center still runs thousands of its websites in ASP (not even ASP.net), and this fact alone is enough to scare me off. With major corporations suffering from data leakage (Sony, Gawker) where user access was compromised, it is high time that the Indian Govt. someone realizes that you cannot secure your systems by locking them in a vault. These companies did the same, and look at the result. 

Even the American Government has come up with an open-source initiative (#TODO)

And lastly, as an analogue to the excellent Right To Information Act, there must be an analogous Right To Technology act. If RTI fought off the beauracracy, this could help us eliminate the old technocrat thinking from the India Govt. 

This could be a turning point in the Indian Govt. Either they could continue what they've been doing and meet their doom in a major state sponsored hack crippling the entire nation. Or they could take a step back, and do things the right way.

And what is the right way? FOSS, Linux and Peace
